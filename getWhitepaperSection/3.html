Each puppy will take time to mature before they\u2019re able to participate in competitions. But don\u2019t worry the time when the puppy is maturing won't be lost. When a puppy is too young to participate in races you can train them to gain valuable stats that will be beneficial to compete once it\u2019s a grown-up dog. The maturing process takes 96 hours. Dogs and their offspring can't be bred with their parents or their siblings or any relative in their bloodline tree.<br>"}},{"id":"Oc6UPB5eM2","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"<u class=\"cdx-underline\">Breeding costs<\/u>"}},{"id":"bfqEIixKCP","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"First breeding cost:<br>$DORC tokens equivalent to 150 BUSD + 3200 [$DRT - DoRac Reward Token].<br>"}},{"id":"qRcKiWr6J0","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"Each subsequent breeding cost:<br>previous $DORC token price with an additional $DORC [100 BUSD equivalent] + previous $DRT with an additional 50% from the previous $DRT procedure price."}},{"id":"xIy6xzcZHF","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"1. 37&nbsp;500 $DORC + 3200 $DRT<br>2. 62 500 $DORC + 4800 $DRT<br>3. 87 500 $DORC + 7200 $DRT [requires lvl 2 building or if bred in 1lvl building +50% $DRT]<br>4. 112 500 $DORC + 10800 $DRT [requires lvl 2 building or if bred in 1lvl building +50% $DRT]<br>5. 137 500 $DORC + 16200 $DRT [requires lvl 3 building or if bred in 2lvl building +50% $DRT, lvl 1 +100% $DRT]<br>6. 162 500 $DORC + 24300 $DRT [requires lvl 3 building or if bred in 2lvl building +50% $DRT, lvl 1 +100% $DRT]"}},{"id":"R7KYV71iP5","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"<u class=\"cdx-underline\">Lock-out periods<\/u>"}},{"id":"axwzmPmFXW","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"There is a \u201clock-out period\u201d between breeding procedures and races which is dependent on the dog\u2019s bloodline.<br>Lock-out period for racing and next breeding procedure:<br>Scruffy - 24 hours followed by: [(24+12)(36+12)(48+24)(72+24)(96+24)]<br>Barto - 36 hours followed by: [(36+12)(48+12)(60+24)(84+24)(108+24)]<br>Bess - 48 hours followed by:\t[(48+12)(60+12)(72+24)(96+24)(120+24)]<br>Cinder - 60 hours followed by: [(60+12)(72+12)(84+24)(108+24)(132+24)]<br>Belphegor - 72 hours followed by: [(72+12)(84+12)(96+24)(120+24)(144+24)]<br>Falon - 84 hours followed by: [(84+12)(96+12)(108+24)(132+24)(156+24)]<br>"}},{"id":"Z-uB2R0prO","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"These limitations also apply to racing, if the dog was in the breeding procedure, he's exhausted and can't race for the same amount of time."}},{"id":"wubiJlGSL_","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"<u class=\"cdx-underline\">Dog retirement and early retirement<\/u>"}},{"id":"iTCublnfbx","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"Dogs whose life span has come to an end are retired automatically.
