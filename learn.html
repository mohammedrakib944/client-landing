            Getting the player ID will be the main part if you want to
            participate in play-to-earn game. ID NFT’s will be your ticket to
            this metaverse space. It will play a big role in how you interact
            with the game and how many things you can do in it. ID NFT’s will
            come all unique with different cosmetic traits.
          </p>

          <p class="simple-para">
            ID’s will have one important stat on them which is going to be REP
            (Reputation). Reputation will show the overall strength of your ID,
            the higher the REP the more discounts and the more actions you can
            take using this specific ID.
          </p>
          <p class="simple-para">
            Discounts on metaverse, the higher the REP – less fees you will have
            to pay for breeding, training and healing your doge. Higher REP also
            means you will be able to buy building upgrades and will determine
            if you can rent them out to other players. Earning REP by
            interacting with metaverse, winning in tournaments and races and
            getting positive feedback from other players by helping them out or
            providing cheaper services via utility facilities.
          </p>
          <p class="simple-para">
            ID will be held on the player’s personal metamask or any other
            wallet that will be able to connect to our platform. These IDs will
            be able to be traded on NFT markets on BSC chain or later in our own

            Initially, the majority of our ecosystem will focus on racing dogs
            in the form of nfts. Doges will be acquired through our pre-sale and
            main-sale events before launching our platform. You will be able to
            get your hands on them via giveaways and special promotional events
            so be sure to join our socials to get info on that. Another way of
            getting them would be using in game market place where you will be
            able to buy them from other players. Later down the road there will
            be more options added which I will not discuss at this time.
          </p>
          <p class="simple-para2">
            Our dogs will have few main traits on them , color will have only
            cosmetic aspect on it. There will be 4 key stats on the dogs:
          </p>
          <p class="simple-para2">
            <span>Agility</span> – will determine your dog’s swiftness
          </p>
          <p class="simple-para2">
            <span> Stamina</span> – will determine your dog’s ability to
            participate in tournaments , if the stamina hits 0 your dog is not
            able to participate in any given tournament nor it can be trained,
            as it is simply exhausted
          </p>
          <p class="simple-para2">
            <span>Weight</span> – obviously will determine the weight of your
            dog.
          </p>
          <p class="simple-para2">
            <span>Luck </span> – will be the most important, this will be the
            only trait you cannot improve, it will be inherited from doges
            parents. This stat will boost your doges chance of successful
            training , wining tournaments , and not getting injured during
            tournaments and competitions.

            Facilities will be structures that players will interact with. At
            first there will be 3 facilities which will be meant specific for
            doges, these are Training grounds, Breeding Houses, and Health
            Centers. Addition to these buildings there will be Marketplace
            building , Utility Shops, Betting office, and Arenas. Some other
            buildings will be added later down the road. Every building in game
            will have two types. Public ones and Private ones. Players will have
            free access to public buildings, if there is free slots in them.
            Public buildings however will ask a service cost from player for
            each action they provide. Private ones will provide owners a way to
            breed, train or heal their doges whenever they want, and with no
            action price. However there will be a some sort of property tax that
            will need to be payed in order to use a building.

        will cost our native token (DORC), Each upgrade will decrease the time
